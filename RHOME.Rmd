## R Markdown


# R Works with outputs. Without a coding block, you must put these in the Console.

#Calculation and String:
"Hello world!" 
# Will print '[1] "Hello world!"'
5 + 5
# Will Print 10! '[1] 10'

#This is a code chunk, runnable in an R-Markdown file. Commands here can be run inside the file.
```{r}
plot(1:10)
```
