## R Setup

R-Studio is the single most popular dedicated IDE for R. 
In Setting up Rstudio, in order to output clean and neat PDF Files, you'll need to type these into the console.

install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()

This isntalls a program called LaTeX (pronounced “lay-tek”) - this will turn our files containing R code into nicely formatted PDFs.
